    I am going to show you a natural language proof of a theorem and a corresponding formal theorem statement in Lean 4. Your job will be to write a formal proof of the formal theorem statement, using the natural language proof as a hint.

Here are the natural language theorem and proof:
\\begin\{theorem\}
    Show that for any natural number $n$, $7$ does not divide $2^n + 1$.
\\end\{theorem\}
If $2^n+1$ is congruent to 0 mod 7, then $2^n$ must be congruent to 6 mod 7, but this is not possible due to how $2^n$ mod 7 cycles. Therefore, there is no solution.

Plan out a plan for your formal proof. You can use the natural language proof as a guide, but there is no need to follow it exactly, or at all. Return this as a list of strings called `proof_steps`, where each proof step is a complete sentence and each proof step logically follows from the previous one.
